### Advent of Code

I've always wanted to dive in and give the Advent of Code a bash so I'm making the effort starting
now (2018). Decemeber is always a busy month – many birthdays along with Christmas – so there's no
doubt I won't be able to complete it all.

I've started programming the solutions in JavaScript as that's most familar to myself. I'm leaning
on a couple of functional libraries (`crocks` and `ramda`) to aid the programming style I feel
comfortable with. I may try the odd solution in Elixir should I feel brave!
